👋 Hello,

- I’m interested in javascript, python, react, typescript, LLMs, PyTorch, Tensorflow, react native, aws cloud, nosql, serverless functions, data security, rapid development. 

- 🌱 I’m currently experimenting with open ai, various copilots, phaserjs , data analysis

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building amazing and impactful systems.

✨ Have a great day! ✨

## What I'm focused on lately

### Mimesys AI
Most recently, I've been working on **Mimesys AI**—a workspace designed to make teams faster with AI *without* relying on endless copy/paste between chat windows.

Mimesys AI emphasizes:
- Multi-model workflows (use different LLMs for different jobs)
- Memory & persistence (reusable context that doesn’t vanish every session)
- Observability (track prompts, results, token usage, latency, and model/version details)
- Collaboration (share threads, invite teammates, co-edit workflows)

## Writing (recent articles)
I write about turning prompting into an engineering discipline—treating outputs like experiments you can iterate, measure, and reuse.
